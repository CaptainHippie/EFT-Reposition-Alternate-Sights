=== EFT REPOSITION UPDATED 2.2 ===

Installation :
Important Note : use Mod organizer 2 using this MO2 guide. Don't mess up your game with JSGME or manual installation and come complaining to mod authors

You have to follow this precise load order below and install any other weapon addons only after everything in here. Keep in mind that none of these mods are mandatory, but use patches only for the mods you have installed. For example if you don't want jsrs, just don't install it's patches but you should follow the order given

1. Install main folder 00. Main EFT reposition
2. Install JSRS 3.6 from moddb
3. Install A.W.A.R. 0.97 from moddb and apply patch folder 01. EFT repos + AWAR 0.97
4. Install Blindside's reanimation from moddb
5. Install adjustable scope view for the sights to scale properly. This just be installed only after the reanim because it makes sure the fov script is upto date
6. Apply patch folder 02. EFT repos + Blindsides reanim (must) and after, optionally you can add 02. EFT repos + Blindsides reanim(vanilla stats) if you want to keep vanilla weapon attributes with just the animation changes(I personally prefer vanilla stats)
7. Install Blindsides JSRS patch from moddb
8. Install Boomsticks and Sharpsticks from moddb(must be 28-Nov-2021 version or it will crash!) and must use the 28 Dec patch if you haven't already. 
9. Must apply BaS patch folder 03. Patch Boomsticks and Sharpsticks
10. After that apply BaS JSRS patch 04. Patch BaS + JSRS if you have JSRS installed and if you want bas guns to use jsrs sounds instead
11. Optional patch for people using BaS and BWRR audio handling pack, use only if you have the addon along with BaS and BWRR installed. Apply main folder 00 and the other two if you prefer
12. Optional but highly recommended, install Firemode switcher sound because its better and I commented out the ones from BaS12. Optional individual weapon mods like G36 pack, Saiga replacer, SVD replacer, Abakan replacer,  must only be installed after all this
