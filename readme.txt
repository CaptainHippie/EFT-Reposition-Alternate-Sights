===EFT REPOSITION UPDATED 1.4===

Installation :
Important Note : use Mod organizer 2 using this MO2 guide. Don't mess up your game with JSGME or manual installation and come complaining to mod authors

You have to follow this precise load order below and install any other weapon addons only after everything in here. Keep in mind that none of these mods are mandatory, but use patches only for the mods you have installed. For example if you don't want jsrs, just don't install it's patches but you should follow the order given

1. Install main folder 00. Main EFT reposition 
2. Install JSRS 3.6
3. Install A.W.A.R. 0.97 and apply patch folder 01. EFT repos + AWAR 0.97
4. Install Blindside's reanimation
5. Install adjustable scope view for the sights to scale properly. This just be installed only after the reanim because it makes sure the fov script is upto date
6. Apply patch folder 02. EFT repos + Blindsides reanim (must) and optionally you can add 02. EFT repos + Blindsides reanim(vanilla stats) if you want to keep vanilla weapon attributes with just the animation change
7. Install Blindsides JSRS patch from
8. Install Boomsticks and Sharpsticks(must be 26-Aug-2021 version or it will crash!) and use the 29th August patch if you haven't already. 
9. Apply BaS patch folder 03. Patch Boomsticks and Sharpsticks
10. Apply BaS JSRS patch 04. Patch BaS + JSRS if you have JSRS installed11. Optional but highly recommended, install Firemode switcher sound because its better and I commented out the ones from BaS12. Optional individual weapon mods like G36 pack, Saiga replacer, SVD replacer, Abakan replacer,  must only be installed after all this

Changelog:
1.4 - Added Hk417 and AUG A3 to the list. These were disabled by default but its easy to renable it. Also updated description to improve compatibility
1.3 - Major Update, merged original EFT reposition with mine so you dont need to install it and I renamed the mod. Fixed fire point and lowered weapon positions, added vanilla stats patch for blindsides. Removed dependancy on weapon_sounds ltx for AWAR.

v1.1 - readjusted sights for all weapons, updated to the latest blindsides reanim with the new L85, disabled alternate am for 1p29 sights on AK103 and AK104 coz they were just too small
