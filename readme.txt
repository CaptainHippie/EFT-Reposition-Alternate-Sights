Changelog:
1.3 - Major Update, merged original EFT reposition with mine so you dont need to install it and I renamed the mod. Fixed fire point and lowered weapon positions, added vanilla stats patch for blindsides. Removed dependancy on weapon_sounds ltx for AWAR.
v1.2 huge update : Added EFT like alternate aims to all pistols, Updated to latest Blindsides reanim and Updated to latest Boomsticks and sharpsticks version
v1.1 hotfix - Fixed blindside's L85A2 sights being wonky
v1.1 - readjusted sights for all weapons, updated to the latest blindsides reanim with the new L85, disabled alternate am for 1p29 sights on AK103 and AK104 coz they were just too small
